Design Choices
-------

I used Ajax to make GET and POST requests to the server when a user enters their sentence. Ajax allows exchanges of small amounts of data to simulate a mock database. It is possible to then update parts of the web page without reloading the whole page. Single page apps, in my opinion, are becoming very hip and also increase user experience. The interface, in general, is very simple and so it is very clear what the application does. I decided to learn how to use a JQuery scroll function to create a more exciting design. I especially enjoyed finding fonts and colors that work together and manipulating them through CSS. I decided to use chai/mocha/selenium for my test stack, because I feel that the combination allows for maximum test coverage. I used the Nyan mocha cat to make testing a little more fun, as well as JSHint to make sure my formatting and syntax is correct. Lint runs after the tests are run, and only logs messages if it finds any errors.
